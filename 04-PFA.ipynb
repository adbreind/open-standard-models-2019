    "*Tools such as Hadoop and Storm provide automated data pipelines, separating the data flow from the functions that are performed on data (mappers and reducers in Hadoop, spouts and bolts in Storm). Ordinarily, these functions are written in code that has access to the pipeline internals, the host operating system, the remote filesystem, the network, etc. However, all they should do is math.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*PFA completes the abstraction by encapsulating these functions as PFA documents. From the point of view of the pipeline system, the documents are configuration files that may be loaded or replaced independently of the pipeline code.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*This separation of concerns allows the data analysis to evolve independently of the pipeline. Since scoring engines written in PFA are not capable of accessing or manipulating their environment, they cannot jeopardize the production system. Data analysts can focus on the mathematical correctness of their algorithms and security reviews are only needed when the pipeline itself changes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "*This decoupling is important because statistical models usually change more quickly than pipeline frameworks. Model details are often tweaked in response to discoveries about the data and models frequently need to be refreshed with new training samples.*"
